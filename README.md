COVID REUNIS PERU ScreenShooter

This proyect make a screenshot from REUNIS COVID page from Peru and save the image with the current date as a filename.

It could be set with cron to make a screenshot every day, and get an historic record from cases in Peru.

It make a screenshot for my city, Trujillo, too. You can easyly config to switch to another city.

I review the stats all days, so I wanna make more easly for me.

This proyect is for fun and I you have any code suggestion send a pull request to make it.

Regards
